Object detection and tracking and counting in real-time using YOLO V8 and SORT algorithm" is a computer vision project that aims to 
detect and track objects in real-time video streams using YOLO V8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, and the Simple Online and Realtime
Tracking (SORT) algorithm, a popular object tracking algorithm. The project involves preprocessing the video stream, applying object detection to 
detect and classify objects in the scene, and then using SORT algorithm to track the detected objects across subsequent frames in the video. 
The project also includes the development of a counting mechanism to count the number of detected and tracked objects in the video stream.
The application of this project can be found in various domains like traffic monitoring, crowd control, and security surveillance.
